                    My group worked individually to come up with some ideas that relates yo our topic, we all need at least 4 ideas just so that we have a lot of things to work with. Then we came together and talked about how all of the ideas we created correlates to other 
                    topics that the group came up with and so we combined them together and made categorys.
